## Visualizing Median Income Change in Cities with New Baseball Stadiums

**Authors:** Eugene Lau, CYPLAN 255

Problem Statement

I am exploring potential relationships between the development of major league baseball stadiums and city level median income data using Census 5 Year ACS data. Broadly I am looking at how the arrival of baseball stadiums produce either negative or positive changes in the financial capacity of surrounding residents. The Census bureau started collecting 5 year ACS data in 2010. In addition the Python library I accessed - CENPY - only provided 5 Year ACS data starting in 2013. To make accurate comparison, I looked at stadiums built between slightly before and during this time span - Nationals Park in DC (2008), Yankee Stadium in NYC (2009), Citi Field in NYC (2009),Target Field in Minneapolis (2010), and Loan Depot Park in Miami (2012).
