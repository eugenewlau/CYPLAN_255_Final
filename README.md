## Visualizing Median Income Change in Cities with New Baseball Stadiums

**Authors:** Eugene Lau, CYPLAN 255

### Problem Statement

I am exploring potential relationships between the development of major league baseball stadiums and city level median income data using Census 5 Year ACS data. Broadly I am looking at how the arrival of baseball stadiums produce either negative or positive changes in the financial capacity of surrounding residents. Economists regularly argue that public funding for sports venues does not bring in the economic and social returns expected by taxpayer investment. This history of public investment in sports venues results in little economic benefit to the surrounding area besides to the investors in the project. Professor of Economics Victor Matheson argues that NFL stadiums in particular make poor neighbors as they generate little to no local economic benefit, bringing in residents already in the metro area, and facilities are hardly utilized beyond for the teamâ€™s benefits. A recent study suggests $33 billion public dollars in the United States went to covering a median of 73% of total construction costs over the past 30 years. These public dollars could have been tailored for essential city services like education, economic development, transportation, and parks maintenance.

### Goals
My goal is to produce chloropleth maps for each of these baseball cities to show the changing median income levels in each of these cities. Most economists argue that investments into sports stadia do not produce economic benefits for the surrounding communities. The Census bureau started collecting 5 year ACS data in 2010. In addition the Python library I accessed - CENPY - only provided 5 Year ACS data starting in 2013. To make accurate comparison, I looked at stadiums built between slightly before and during this time span - Nationals Park in DC (2008), Yankee Stadium in NYC (2009), Citi Field in NYC (2009),Target Field in Minneapolis (2010), and Loan Depot Park in Miami (2012).
